# Supertonic Flutter Example

This example demonstrates how to use Supertonic in a Flutter application using ONNX Runtime.

> **Note:** This project uses the `flutter_onnxruntime` package ([https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_onnxruntime](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_onnxruntime)). At the moment, only the macOS platform has been tested. Although the flutter_onnxruntime package supports several other platforms, they have not been tested in this project yet and may require additional verification.
